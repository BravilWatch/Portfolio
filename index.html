<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lights Out</span></strong> - Download - Reference Images</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A short game I made as part of a small team of students each serving a different role studying different elements of computer science, varying from game design to buisness computing. Made in the Unreal Engine this project was intended to showcase our abilty to manage a project as a team. Co-ordination was very important during this task, especially due to our use of github for version control. We ensured the group was well co-ordinated by holding weekly meetings both virtually and privately. During these meetings the group would discuss their progress, be assigned new tasks or members of the group would support people struggling on certain tasks. There was also a strong emphesis on applying good coding practices such as appropriate variable names and descriptive comments, as well as comprehensively documenting changes on git pushes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this project I served as team lead/developer. My role as team lead meant that I was in charge of co-ordinating with the lecturer as well as ensuring the team had a clear vision for the project during the meetings I arranged. During the project I prioritised and distributed tasks, taking into account the diverse skills of the team.</p>
<p>My own programming role in this task involved designing and implementing a puzzle the player had to complete to finish the game, scattered throughout the map are parts the player must collect, once these parts were collected the player had to solve a puzzle involving rotating pieces to connect one end of a circuit board to another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Group Size - 6</p>
<p>Role - Team Lead / Developer</p>
<p>We had to contact a client and manage a project from its inception to completion, meaning we met with a client to discuss what their vision for the project was and talked them through what we could provide given our severe time constraint, eventually working with them to create a plan for when we started development. Our goal was to create a high fidelity recreation of the client's office they could use to familiarise patients with the environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my role as team lead I was in charge of all communications with the client, managing the group and allocating tasks. This involved disscussions with the team members about their strengths and weaknesses and assigning tasks they were comfortable they could complete. It also involved arranging regular meetings where we would discuss progress and resolve any blockers that arose. My final responsibility in this role was communicating with the client, this involved short discussions on our progress and requesting additional resources so we could more accurately depict the office, we also had to consider the client's time and not message them an innapropriate ammount or at innapropriate times.</p>
<p>In my role as developer I had to design the staircase, hallway and the waiting room, this involved creating assets in blender that resembled the office furniture, as well as making sure the hallway was built in a way that would accomidate the other team member's rooms without too much remodeling.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Untitled Hornet Engine Game</strong></span> - Download - Reference Images - Credit to Chris Rook of Northumbia University for providing the Hornet Engine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Game built on a low level game engine provided by the university, Lecturers provided an engine that could display images and take inputs and then expected us to build a game that demonstrated proficiency in C++, focusing on low level features such as code quality and naked pointer use and object orienation. We were also assessed on the complexity and suitability of the game mechanics and our implementation of polymorphic techniques.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PS4 Devkit Work</strong></span> - Reference Images</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During my time at University I was afforded the opportunity to work with a Playstation 4 Devkit. We were tasked with creating a rendering and lighting pipeline within C++ using PSSL. This meant creating and simulating hard coded shapes, as well as converting external files to a usable format and simulating shapes drawn from the data. These shapes were then made to simulate a solar system by orbiting a central object or orbiting objects within the system like a moon would. Finally we had to simulate an offscreen light source which "lit" one side of the object while leaving the other side unlit. These objects could be manipulated by user inputs using a PS4 controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project is subject to an NDA so no code can be provided</p>
